Running the Application:
To get the Inventory Management System App up and running locally, follow these simple steps for both the backend and frontend:

1. Setting up the Backend:
Navigate to the backend directory:
bash
cd backend
Install all the necessary dependencies:
bash
npm install
Start the backend server by running:
bash
npm start
The backend should now be running on http://localhost:5000 or the port defined in your environment variables.

3. Setting up the Frontend:
Navigate to the frontend directory:
bash
cd frontend
Install all frontend dependencies:
bash
npm install
Start the frontend development server:
bash
npm start
This will launch the app in your default browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.
