# Running the Application

To get the **Inventory Management System** up and running locally, follow these simple steps for both the backend and frontend:

---

## 1. Setting up the Backend:

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install all the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. The backend should now be running at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
   or on the port defined in your environment variables.

## 2. Setting up the Frontend:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install all frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. This will launch the app in your default browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Notes:
- Ensure you have the correct environment variables set up in `.env` files for both the frontend and backend.
